        <p>For this project the task was to create a budget calculator 
            while using JavaScript. We got the calculator from the 
            brochure of EECU. I didn't do the mood boards on this project 
            since it was only going to be three pages. So I started working
            on my Figma Prototype. When I finished my Figma prototype I started
            working on the website on VS Code. I had to investigate how a normal
            calculator works in JavaScript so I can make my own budget calculator.
            I reflected on a lot of the pages to make them similar to the brochure.
            A challenge for me that I struggled so much was the budget calculator 
            becayse I had to include JavaScript and I was still learning on how to include
            JavaScript since I didn't have enough time to do it. I had to make a chart representing
            it the way the budget calculator would look like. Finally I used Netlify to host my code.
