        <p>We were assigned to create a website out of this story we read in English Class.
            The story we read is called "The Machine Stops". It's about how humans have lost
            the ability to live on the surface of earth. They now live in these underground homes,
            each person has their own room. There is this machine (robot) who brings them food
            and brings their clothes. They even have buttons to press in need of assistance. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>After we read that story in English, everyone got paird with someone of their choice.
            The task was to create a website of these homes and try to sell them to potential buyers
            looking for underground homes. Me and my partner first started off by creating our own
            individual mood boards, we used canva during this process. When using canva I learned 
            how to create color palettes. I created my first 3 and he created his 2. Then from there 
            we ended up picking one of my mood boards. From there we used Figma and started planning 
            out our wireframes on how they were going to look for our website. The goal of using Figma 
            is using it to make our wireframes and prototypes. We had some challenges at first with the 
            Figma since it was out first wireframe and we were learning how to use the tools.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>After we successfully finished our wireframes, we started coding on our website using 
            Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The goal of using vs code is to code for our website and 
            get the pages connected and images connected to take you to another page of the website.
            The goal was to also write our HTML and CSS because those two are important. Me and my 
            partner collaborted by him doing the CSS and me doing the HTML. When he finished the CSS
            and when I finished the HTML we combined them together. We communicated a lot during this
            process to clarify if it is how we want it to look like. When we finished we used Netlify 
            to publish our website.

        <p>We go assigned to pick a current event of choice. The topic had to be related
            to an issue in the world where I am informing visitors about the problem and 
            communicating with them on how they can get involved and contributre to change 
            on an individual level. I picked Power Conservation. One student would work on 
            another student's website. While the owner of that website would be leading them
            on how to do it. This was how it was for everyone in class. Eveyone would eventually
            work with everyone in class for developer and leader. Ther would be rounds to switch
            off from being a developer to a leader or the other way around.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The first software that I used was Canva to work on my mood boards. My mom boads helped
            me pick out a theme for my website. Since my topic was Power Conservation, I picked my 
            theme to be about nature since Power Conservation is about nature and saving energy for
            our planet. Before it was time to work with partners I had to investigate the topic in 
            order to complete this website, because I had to get all the information. When it was time
            to do partners, the developer and the leader. The first round I was the leader and the other 
            student was the developer. At first the developer had some trouble with starting it, especially
            trying to get the hero image to fit. He had some trouble along with other developers having some 
            trouble but then it eventually got fixed. There was lot of communication between the developer 
            and the leader (me) because they wanted to make sure that it was looking how I wanted it to look like.
            After some rounds. I finished it off with final touches and hosted it on Netlify.

        <p>For this assignment we got assigned to pick a board game and create it into a website
            but with the game there had to be a twist that is not in the original game. Each group 
            was three people. My group picked connect 4 because the concept of the game was easy to 
            understand.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>We first had to work on a physical prototype to see the mechancis of the game like the board game but with 
            our twist in the game to see how it would play out. We also got recommendations from classmates on what to 
            add and what to take away.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>After we tested our prototypes physical version. We started working on Figma and Lucidchart.
            We use google doc to write the rules of our game. We all collaborted in each one. One would 
            Lucidchart and one would being doing the google doc for the rules of our game. Expect on the 
            Figma each one of us contributre to doing a page. From there we started working on Visual 
            Studio Code to the game while using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. One of the challengesmy group faced
            is getting the dice to work and the point system working with the board along with the checkers.
            In the end we got it all sorted out.

        <p>For this project the task was to create a budget calculator 
            while using JavaScript. We got the calculator from the 
            brochure of EECU. I didn't do the mood boards on this project 
            since it was only going to be three pages. So I started working
            on my Figma Prototype. When I finished my Figma prototype I started
            working on the website on VS Code. I had to investigate how a normal
            calculator works in JavaScript so I can make my own budget calculator.
            I reflected on a lot of the pages to make them similar to the brochure.
            A challenge for me that I struggled so much was the budget calculator 
            becayse I had to include JavaScript and I was still learning on how to include
            JavaScript since I didn't have enough time to do it. I had to make a chart representing
            it the way the budget calculator would look like. Finally I used Netlify to host my code.
