        <p>Hi I am Karla Hernandez Martinez. I will be graduating from Clovis High School
           in 2024. I currently attend The Center for Advanced Research Technology(CART).
           CART is helping me explore my options for my career in the near future.
            A little about my family is that I have one big brother and one little sister,
            which puts me as the middle child. My mom and dad both are from Mexico City.
            I also have a turtle whose name is Spongebob. Some of my hobbies include dancing and listeing to music. I love dancing so much
            especially in folklorico because I get to connect with my culture and learn more about
            different regions.
        </p>

    <div class="cart text">
        <p>At my time at CART I have made in total of 4 websites in Web Application
            and those can be found in my portfolio page. I am most proud of 
            the Line-Up game that me and my group made because it took us a lot of
            time to work on and learn a lot of JavaScript in order for that game to
            work. In the end, playing the game was really fun. You should check it out.

    <h1>4 Year Plan</h1>
    <div class="four">
        <br>
        <p>After I graduate high school, I want to go to college. I am planning
            to major in biology and possibly a minor in business. I either want
            to stay in California or go to Oregon. Get my Bachelors Degree in 
            Biology or Dentistry, then when I gradute from College and get my 
            Bachelors Degree in Biology or Dentistry. I will go to Dental School
            for 2 or 4 years depending on the program. When I graduate from Dental
            Schoo, I will open my own office and hire people to work for me.
