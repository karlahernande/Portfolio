    <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hi I am Karla Hernandez Martinez. I will be graduating from Clovis High School
           in 2024. I currently attend The Center for Advanced Research Technology(CART).
           CART is helping me explore my options for my career in the near future.
            About my family is I have one big brother and one little sister,
             My mom and dad both are from Mexico City.
            As for pets, I have a water turtle named spongebob and a tortise named sandy and a cat named flaquita. Some of my awards and achievements is getting Academic Block "C" 
            9th grade and 10th grade and also getting High Honor Roll for 9th grade and 10th grade. Also getting Certificate of Achievement (Above a 3.0) from AVID.
            Some of my hobbies include dancing and listeing to music. I love dancing so much
            especially in folklorico because I get to connect with my culture and learn more about
            different regions.

    <div class="cart text">
        <p>At my time at CART I have made in total of 4 websites in Web Application
            and those can be found in my portfolio page. I am most proud of 
            the Line-Up game that me and my group made because it took us a lot of
            time to work on and learn a lot of JavaScript in order for that game to
            work. In the end, playing the game was really fun. You should check it out, you 
            will find it in my portfolio page.

    <div class="four">
        <br>
        <p>After I graduate high school, I want to go to college. I am planning
            to major in biology and possibly a minor in business. I either want
            to stay in California or go to Oregon. Get my Bachelors Degree in 
            Biology or Dentistry, then when I gradute from College and get my 
            Bachelors Degree in Biology or Dentistry. I will go to Dental School
            for 2 or 4 years depending on the program. When I graduate from Dental
            School, I will open my own office and hire people to work for me.
