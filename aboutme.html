    <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hi I am Karla Hernandez Martinez. I graduated from Clovis High School
           on May 29, 2024. In the fall of 2024. I will be attending California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB).
           My time at Clovis High School and CART have helped me so much grow as a person and a student. To never care
           for what others think of me. Always be true to myself. I will like to thank all the people who have helped me 
           throughout my years in high school. To all the amazing people I have met along the way. Couldn't have done it 
           without you guys. 
           Some of the extra curriculars that I have done throughout my time in high school is being apart of El Alma De Clovis High (folklorico
           dance team). I have put my soul in it and dedication for three years. From learing so many different regions, dance and to meeting amazing new people.
           Becoming a family and growing each with other. I have Mrs. Macias to thank her for making it a safe place for me. 
           Another big involvement I was part of was AVID. AVID is where I get to throughly part of myself. Apart from having the fun field trips and yapping mostly 
           all period. I love AVID. AVID in my last year I got to really connect with 9 amazing girls. Where we were all their for each other and being supportive of each other
           giving other advice. Being more relatable since it was a full class of girls. I get to thank Mrs. Beauchamp for that. She truly understand us so well. So 
           greatful to have her my teacher for my 4 years of high school. Being my health teacher during my freshman year and becoming my AVID teacher the rest of my high school years.

        <p>At my time at CART I have made in total of 4 websites in Web Application
            and those can be found in my portfolio page. I am most proud of 
            the Line-Up game that me and my group made because it took us a lot of
            time to work on and learn a lot of JavaScript in order for that game to
            work. In the end, playing the game was really fun. You should check it out, you 
            will find it in my portfolio page.

    <div class="four">
        <br>
        <p>After I graduate high school, I want to go to college. I am planning
            to major in biology and possibly a minor in business. I either want
            to stay in California or go to Oregon. Get my Bachelors Degree in 
            Biology or Dentistry, then when I gradute from College and get my 
            Bachelors Degree in Biology or Dentistry. I will go to Dental School
            for 2 or 4 years depending on the program. When I graduate from Dental
            School, I will open my own office and hire people to work for me.
