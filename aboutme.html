    <div class="about-text">
        <p>Hi I am Karla Hernandez Martinez. I graduated from Clovis High School
           on May 29, 2024. In the fall of 2024. I will be attending California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB).
           My time at Clovis High School and CART have helped me so much grow as a person and a student. To never care
           for what others think of me. Always be true to myself. I will like to thank all the people who have helped me 
           throughout my years in high school. To all the amazing people I have met along the way. Couldn't have done it 
           without you guys. 
           Some of the extra curriculars that I have done throughout my time in high school is being apart of El Alma De Clovis High (folklorico
           dance team). I have put my soul in it and dedication for three years. From learing so many different regions, dance and to meeting amazing new people.
           Becoming a family and growing each with other. I have Mrs. Macias to thank her for making it a safe place for me. 
           Another big involvement I was part of was AVID. AVID is where I get to throughly part of myself. Apart from having the fun field trips and yapping mostly 
           all period. I love AVID. AVID in my last year I got to really connect with 9 amazing girls. Where we were all their for each other and being supportive of each other
           giving other advice. Being more relatable since it was a full class of girls. I get to thank Mrs. Beauchamp for that. She truly understand us so well. So 
           greatful to have her my teacher for my 4 years of high school. Being my health teacher during my freshman year and becoming my AVID teacher the rest of my high school years.

        <p>My advice I would like to give underclassman and upcoming seniors is to cherised the memories you make in highschool because
            life does move really fast. When you feel life moving really fast, just stand where you are and really just take a look 
            around and soak the feeling, the memory, the time. Really appreciated it because not everyone will be forever in the same room,
            moment ever again. Do everything in you senior year especailly!! Go to senior sunrise, senior sunset, grad nite/grad bash, senior ditch day, go to 
            the farmers market with your friends, go to the movies, go suprise your friends for their birthday, go have fun because after that life starts.
