        <p>For this assignment we got assigned to pick a board game and create it into a website
            but with the game there had to be a twist that is not in the original game. Each group 
            was three people. My group picked connect 4 because the concept of the game was easy to 
            understand.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>We first had to work on a physical prototype to see the mechancis of the game like the board game but with 
            our twist in the game to see how it would play out. We also got recommendations from classmates on what to 
            add and what to take away.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>After we tested our prototypes physical version. We started working on Figma and Lucidchart.
            We use google doc to write the rules of our game. We all collaborted in each one. One would 
            Lucidchart and one would being doing the google doc for the rules of our game. Expect on the 
            Figma each one of us contributre to doing a page. From there we started working on Visual 
            Studio Code to the game while using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. One of the challengesmy group faced
            is getting the dice to work and the point system working with the board along with the checkers.
            In the end we got it all sorted out.
