        <p>Career of Choice is a research essay. The purpose of this writing is to pick a career that I want to pursue in the near future and do some research about this career. The career that I choose is Dentist. To this essay there were 8 body paragraphs in total. In my English class my teacher assigned per week separte parts of each section of the essay so we truly focused on it and looked well throughout our research. The reason I choose this career is because it fascinates me. I think Dentistry is cool since it is like a combination of art and science. Some of the challenges that I stuggle with this assigment is starting new paragraphs. In order to write this essay I had to investigate sources about how to become a dentisit and the education. This essay helped me research more about the career of becoming a dentist. I selected this sample because it took so much time for me to type.

        <p>The Veldt Poster is based on a sotry we read in english class. This type of writing is a creative. The purpose of this writing is to
            pick two lines in the story and pick two photos that represent the meaning of these two lines. These two lines that I pick are effects of the technology on the Haldey family unit. The pictures that I pick represent well with the lines I pick. I selected this as a sample to share because I really like the pictures that I selected for the lines.
