        <p>We go assigned to pick a current event of choice. The topic had to be related
            to an issue in the world where I am informing visitors about the problem and 
            communicating with them on how they can get involved and contributre to change 
            on an individual level. I picked Power Conservation. One student would work on 
            another student's website. While the owner of that website would be leading them
            on how to do it. This was how it was for everyone in class. Eveyone would eventually
            work with everyone in class for developer and leader. Ther would be rounds to switch
            off from being a developer to a leader or the other way around.
        </p>

        <p>The first software that I used was Canva to work on my mood boards. My mom boads helped
            me pick out a theme for my website. Since my topic was Power Conservation, I picked my 
            theme to be about nature since Power Conservation is about nature and saving energy for
            our planet. Before it was time to work with partners I had to investigate the topic in 
            order to complete this website, because I had to get all the information. When it was time
            to do partners, the developer and the leader. The first round I was the leader and the other 
            student was the developer. At first the developer had some trouble with starting it, especially
            trying to get the hero image to fit. He had some trouble along with other developers having some 
            trouble but then it eventually got fixed. There was lot of communication between the developer 
            and the leader (me) because they wanted to make sure that it was looking how I wanted it to look like.
            After some rounds. I finished it off with final touches and hosted it on Netlify.
