        <p>We were assigned to create a website out of this story we read in English Class.
            The story we read is called "The Machine Stops". It's about how humans have lost
            the ability to live on the surface of earth. They now live in these underground homes,
            each person has their own room. There is this machine (robot) who brings them food
            and brings their clothes. They even have buttons to press in need of assistance. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>After we read that story in English, everyone got paird with someone of their choice.
            The task was to create a website of these homes and try to sell them to potential buyers
            looking for underground homes. Me and my partner first started off by creating our own
            individual mood boards, we used canva during this process. When using canva I learned 
            how to create color palettes. I created my first 3 and he created his 2. Then from there 
            we ended up picking one of my mood boards. From there we used Figma and started planning 
            out our wireframes on how they were going to look for our website. The goal of using Figma 
            is using it to make our wireframes and prototypes. We had some challenges at first with the 
            Figma since it was out first wireframe and we were learning how to use the tools.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>After we successfully finished our wireframes, we started coding on our website using 
            Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The goal of using vs code is to code for our website and 
            get the pages connected and images connected to take you to another page of the website.
            The goal was to also write our HTML and CSS because those two are important. Me and my 
            partner collaborted by him doing the CSS and me doing the HTML. When he finished the CSS
            and when I finished the HTML we combined them together. We communicated a lot during this
            process to clarify if it is how we want it to look like. When we finished we used Netlify 
            to publish our website.
